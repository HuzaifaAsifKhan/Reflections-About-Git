i just check diff between two files its easy method but see what happen next......
1       git clone :::::::: to download different repositiory From another Computer or other Links Like GitHub... 
2       git diff  1st commit 2nd commit:::::::: find difference between two commits.
3       git log:::::::: To get all commit records in selected repository (short discription).
Now Till Lesson1 Lecture 26 i learn 1 more command git checkout
4      git checkout::::::: you can go any where using this command Like any previous commit you made in this repository.
and get back using same comman But keepin mind previuos commit satate is not shown to if you use "git log" so must remember  last commit SHA or ID.otherwise it is very difficult to get back at that point,....
